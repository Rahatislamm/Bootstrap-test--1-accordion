           The modern accordion has three primary sections, 
           <b>the expandable bellows and the two wooden end units called the treble and bass ends</b>. 
               This helps keep it away from h
               
               umidity and other things that
               might damage the instrument. 
               Try to keep it out of too much 
               heat, cold, or humidity. The reeds
               inside the accordion might bend 
               out of tune if theres too much
               humidity.
